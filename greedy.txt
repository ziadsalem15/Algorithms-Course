################################## Task 3A: Greedy Algorithm ############################################
Explain why a greedy approach is not necessarily optimal for 0/1
and state with explanation whether it is optimal for the fractional case?

*** 0/1 Knapsack: For Greedy Algorithm we first sort according to profit and weight ratio
then we keep adding the biggest values where the total weight is less than the Knapsack
weight and we skip some items in between if doesn't fit and keep iterating over the NITEMS
So, we may reach a point where no any item fit but there are still space left and we
can't cut off items so the choice made by greedy Algorithm may depend on choices
it has made so far, but it is not aware of future choices it could make.

It is optimal for fractional knapsack. The proof of this theorem uses an exchange argument to
show that the greedy method works to solve this problem optimally. The general structure
of such an argument is a proof by contradiction, where we assume, for the sake of reaching a
contradiction, that there is a better solution than one found by the greedy algorithm.
We then argue that there is an exchange that we could make among the components of
this solution that would lead to a better solution. In this case, this approach shows
that the greedy method can effectively be used to solve the fractional knapsack problem.
