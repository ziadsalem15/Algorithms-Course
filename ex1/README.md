The repository for COMP26120 for AY 2019/2020

This repository contains a branch for each exercise and some helpful scripts. See the comments at the start of each script for what they do.

Note that the starting code for many of the exercises is not here yet. It will be made available before Reading Week and will be accessible by using the refresh script.

You should do all your work for an exercise in a branch with the same name.

See the COMP26120 website for further details.
